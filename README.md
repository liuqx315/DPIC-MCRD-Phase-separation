<h4> The code and data also were deposited at Figshare with DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.26057656 </h4>

## Guide for Code
This folder includes five subfolders, from Fig. 2 to Fig. 6.
## Fig1:
-	Fig1fn_code: data fit the response function and BIC/AIC criterion for model selection. 
## Fig2:
-	Fig2b_code: Contains the numerical simulation codes for Figure 2b.
-	Fig2c_code: Contains the numerical simulation codes for Figure 2c.
-	These codes can be run directly with Jupyter Notebook withi OpenCL.
## Fig3:
-	Code folder: Includes the model simulation and data analysis codes using Matlab. It covers structure factor analysis, experimental data, and simulation output.
## Fig4:
-	fig3code, fig4data, and fig4figs folders: Include the code, data, and output results, respectively.
## Fig5:
-	Stores the code and data within different subfolders, respectively. Data for plotting the figure were deposited in Figshare, including both experimental and simulation data.
## Fig6:
-	Contains the data on ripple development from the previously published literature by Ping Lv, Clément Narteau, et al., PNAS 2021 Vol. 118 No. 17 e2024105118. Data is taken from Figure 5(B).
